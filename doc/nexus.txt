 1. INTRODUCTION                                    *:List*  *nexus-intro*

The simplest way to use Nexus is through the |:List| command.
Visually select a range of lines and type |:List| to have
them numbered from 1 with leading 0 padding where appropriate.

TIP: If you want to change the default behaviour, |:List| accepts
     the same arguments as |:Nexus| below.

|:List| adds numbers to the start of every line in the provided
range. If you need to number elements within a line then you need to
use |:Nexus| instead.

Nexus provides generators for Vim - perhaps more easily thought of as
numerical series. Two examples of simple generators are:
  * the number sequence from one to ten, and
  * an alphabetic sequence from 'a' to 'z'
and Nexus provides several other built-in generators, like:
  * Roman Numerals, and
  * Fibonacci Numbers
and Nexus also allows you to create your own generators. The Fibonacci
Number generators is there as an example on how you would write your own
generator more than being useful in its own right.

 2. EXAMPLES                                    *:Nexus*  *nexus-examples*

No arguments:~
>
  :Nexus
<
Will create a simple numeric sequence starting at 0 and incrementing
by 1 with each call to Nexus(). To replace all "foo" in your file
with this series you could then use:
>
  :%s/foo/\=Nexus()/g
<
Nexus initialisation and substitute as a single command sequence:~
>
  :Nexus 10 1 %d, | %s/^\(\d*,\)\?/\=Nexus()/
<
NOTE: The above command renumbers lines in the file starting from a
count of 10, incrementing by 1 each line, replacing existing numbers
if present. It uses a format of "%d," to separate the new number
from the rest of the line text with a comma.

                                              *nexus-start-step-arguments*
Start and Step arguments:~

Numeric arguments will be parsed as follows:
<
  :Nexus [step]
  :Nexus start step
>
So:
>
  :Nexus 2   " yields a counter starting at 0 with a step of 2: 0, 2, 4
  :Nexus 3 2 " yields a counter starting at 3 with a step of 2: 3, 5, 7,
<
                                                         *nexus-generator*
Generator~

A function name will change the generator used in the Nexus() callback
accordingly:
>
  :Nexus nexus#fibonacci
<
or, if you've written your own generator for, say, prime numbers:
>
  :Nexus Primes
<
                                                   *nexus-format-function*
Format Function~

An argument that contains a : or % will be taken as the format string.
The default format string is: '%d' which simply expands to the
(numeric!) value of the next item in the series at each call. If your
generator yields non-numeric values (such as the built-in nexus#alpha)
then you will need to create your own format string accordingly:
>
  :Nexus %s\  nexus#alpha
<
NOTE: There are two spaces after the "\" -- the first is captured as
part of the format string and the second separates the two arguments
(format string and generator).

These arguments may appear in any order with the caveat that the
"step" or "start -and- step" will always be considered in that
order when numbers appear anywhere as standalone arguments. So,
although the following layout is not recommended for reader-clarity,
it is nonetheless possible:
>
  :Nexus 1 nexus#alpha %s\  2
<
and will create an alpha series starting at the first term and step by
two with each call to Nexus(). This will generate: b, d, f, h, j, ...

NOTE: Nexus generators are zero indexed. The zeroth alpha term is 'a'.

                                          *nexus-default-sequence-objects*
Default Sequence Objects~

By default, Nexus comes with a linear numeric generator and two global
objects which use it:

* s0
* s1

These objects have a method called "next()" which returns the next
number in the series. As the name implies, the first such number is 1.
There is a corresponding "s0" object whose first call to "next()"
yields, of course, the number 0. Users are free to create their own
objects from the default numeric generator too:
>
  :let even_seq = Series(2)
<
The command:
>
  :echo even_seq.next()
<
will print 0 on the first call, then 2, then 4, 6, 8, 10, etc, on subsequent calls.

                                                *nexus-series-constructor*
The Nexus command uses the Series function behind the scenes. You have direct
access to this object generator for the creation of your own series objects.

The Series constructor has the following signatures:~
Given these arguments   -> produces objects that yield these values on .next()

* Series()              -> 0, 1, 2, ...
* Series(7)             -> 0, 7, 14, ...
* Series(7, 2)          -> 7, 9, 11, ...
* Series(2, 7)          -> 2, 9, 16, ...
* Series('nexus#alpha') -> 'a', 'b', 'c', ...
* Series('(%d) ')       -> (0) , (1) , (2) , ...

                                                    *nexus-series-methods*
Nexus's Series Objects provide the following methods:~

* reset() to set the object back to its original values when created
* next()  to return the next number in the series and increment
* value() to return the current value without incrementing internal state

                                                  *nexus-other-generators*
Other Generators~

Other generators can be written for Nexus and passed to Series() as
a string in the first argument:
>
  :let fib = Series('nexus#fibonacci')
<
Will create a Series object called "fib" that generates the Fibonacci
sequence on each subsequent ".next()" call. This generator and object
exist by default in the Nexus plugin. They are not expected to be
useful in themselves but rather serve to demonstrate how user-created
generators can be used with Nexus. Consult the code in
"plugin/nexus.vim" to learn how to craft your generator.

Nexus provides the following builtin generators:

* nexus#series    -- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...           [DEFAULT]
* nexus#alpha     -- a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ac, ...
* nexus#roman     -- I, II, III, IV, V, ...
* nexus#fibonacci -- 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...
